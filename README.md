This repository details the use of a 4x4 matrix keypad via an Arduino Uno microcontroller to implement a simple security system that allows the user to input a 4 digit passcode to do something in return. I've left the .ino code open to modification, so that if someone would like to wire a motor or buzzer of some sort to activate when the passcode is entered correctly/incorrectly, they can do so. 

Here is a video of the keypad system working:
